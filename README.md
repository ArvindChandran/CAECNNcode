#  Deeplearning Steganalysis

**Steganography and Steganalysis**  


***

Steganography is the science to conceal secrect messages in the images though slightly modifying the pixel values. Content-adaptive steganographic schemes tend to embed the messages in complex regions to escape from detection are the most secure method in nowadays. Examples in spatial domain include HUGO, WOW, S-UNIWARD.   
Corresponding to steganography, steganalysis is the art of detecting hidden data in images. Usually, this task is formulated as a binary classification problem to distinguish between cover and stego.
